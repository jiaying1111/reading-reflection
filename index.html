                Schwulst’s “My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?</a></h3>
        <p>Reading Laurel Schwulst’s writing helped me rethink what a website can be and why I might want to make one.
            Instead of seeing a website as a finished portfolio or a place to “explain myself clearly,” I started to
            understand it as a space that can be personal, unfinished, and alive. Schwulst’s idea that a website can be
            a
            room, a garden, or even a puddle made me feel less pressure to make something perfect, and more freedom to
            make
            something honest.

            Inspired by this, my first website would not be organized by time or productivity, but by language and
            feeling.
            nstead of telling one clear story from beginning to end, the site presents fragments of a narrative—poems,
            short
            texts, or scenes—that can be entered from many points. Rather than presenting a clear narrative, the site
            would
            allow ambiguity and softness. It could be something you wander through, rather than something you
            “understand”
            immediately.

            This idea connects to Project 1 because it treats the website itself as the work, not just a container for
            other
            works. The structure, typography, spacing, and navigation all become part of the meaning. Like Schwulst
            describes, the website would shape how I see myself during this transitional moment, while also changing as
            I
            add to it over time. Overall, this reading encouraged me to see my first website as a space for exploration
            rather than resolution—a place to sit with uncertainty, process change, and let ideas grow slowly.</p>

        <h2>Week 2</h2>
        <h3><a href="https://luckysoap.com/statements/handmadeweb.html" target="_blank"> J. R. Carpenter, A Handmade
                Web</a></h3>
        <p>Reading J. R. Carpenter’s writing on the “handmade web” made me more aware of how different the early web was
            from the one we experience today, and how much has been lost along the way. The idea of the handmade web
            emphasizes slowness, individuality, and care—qualities that feel increasingly rare in a digital environment
            dominated by platforms, templates, and algorithms. Carpenter’s description of hand-coded websites as
            provisional, personal, and sometimes temporary helped me see these qualities not as limitations, but as
            strengths.

            What stood out to me most was the comparison between handmade web pages and zines or artist books. Like
            those physical formats, handmade websites can be intimate, experimental, and unconcerned with polish or
            scale. The fact that many early web works still exist in their original medium, even as technologies around
            them change, highlights how the web can function as a living archive rather than a static record.

            This reading encouraged me to rethink my own approach to web-making. Instead of aiming for efficiency,
            visibility, or completeness, it made me interested in building websites that embrace imperfection,
            ephemerality, and personal authorship.</p>

        <h2>Week 3</h2>
        <h3><a href="https://www.are.na/block/33920329" target="_blank">Hello World by Taeyoon Choi</a></h3>
        <p>Reading Hell World by Taeyoon Choi made me rethink my relationship with computers—not as seamless
            tools, but as layered objects shaped by labor, history, and abstraction. What stood out to me most was
            Choi’s decision to physically build a computer in order to understand it. This act resists the “black box”
            nature of contemporary technology, where interfaces are designed to be smooth while concealing their inner
            logic. By slowing down and engaging with circuits, repetition, and failure, Choi reframes computation as
            something human, imperfect, and poetic.

            I was especially drawn to the idea that computation, architecture, and art share a common language of
            abstraction and repetition. The comparison between microchips, abstract paintings, and city plans helped me
            see how systems scale—from silicon to cities—while still being shaped by human values and decisions. At the
            same time, Choi reminds us that life cannot be reduced to binary logic. Cities, like people, are
            unpredictable and full of glitches.

            This reading connects strongly to ideas of handmade or experimental approaches to technology. It suggests
            that understanding how things are built gives us agency to question what kinds of systems we want to live
            with.</p>
