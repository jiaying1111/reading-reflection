                <p class="p">
                    Reading Laurel Schwulst’s writing helped me rethink what a website can be and why I might want to
                    make one. Instead of seeing a website as a finished portfolio or a place to “explain myself
                    clearly,”
                    I started to understand it as a space that can be personal, unfinished, and alive. Schwulst’s idea
                    that a website can be a room, a garden, or even a puddle made me feel less pressure to make
                    something
                    perfect, and more freedom to make something honest.

                    Inspired by this, my first website would not be organized by time or productivity, but by language
                    and feeling. Instead of telling one clear story from beginning to end, the site presents fragments
                    of
                    a narrative—poems, short texts, or scenes—that can be entered from many points. Rather than
                    presenting
                    a clear narrative, the site would allow ambiguity and softness. It could be something you wander
                    through, rather than something you “understand” immediately.

                    This idea connects to Project 1 because it treats the website itself as the work, not just a
                    container
                    for other works. The structure, typography, spacing, and navigation all become part of the meaning.
                    Like Schwulst describes, the website would shape how I see myself during this transitional moment,
                    while also changing as I add to it over time. Overall, this reading encouraged me to see my first
                    website as a space for exploration rather than resolution.

                </div>

                <p class="p">
                    Reading J. R. Carpenter’s writing on the “handmade web” made me more aware of how different the
                    early
                    web was from the one we experience today, and how much has been lost along the way. The idea of the
                    handmade web emphasizes slowness, individuality, and care—qualities that feel increasingly rare in a
                    digital environment dominated by platforms, templates, and algorithms.

                    What stood out to me most was the comparison between handmade web pages and zines or artist books.
                    Like those physical formats, handmade websites can be intimate, experimental, and unconcerned with
                    polish or scale. The fact that many early web works still exist in their original medium highlights
                    how the web can function as a living archive rather than a static record.

                    This reading encouraged me to rethink my own approach to web-making. Instead of aiming for
                    efficiency, visibility, or completeness, it made me interested in building websites that embrace
                    imperfection, ephemerality, and personal authorship.

                <p class="p">
                    Reading Hell World by Taeyoon Choi made me rethink my relationship with computers—not as seamless
                    tools, but as layered objects shaped by labor, history, and abstraction. What stood out to me most
                    was Choi’s decision to physically build a computer in order to understand it.

                    I was especially drawn to the idea that computation, architecture, and art share a common language
                    of abstraction and repetition. The comparison between microchips, abstract paintings, and city plans
                    helped me see how systems scale while still being shaped by human values and decisions.

                    This reading connects strongly to ideas of handmade or experimental approaches to technology. It
                    suggests that understanding how things are built gives us agency to question what kinds of systems
                    we
                    want to live with.
